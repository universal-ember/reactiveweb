/**
 * A utility decorator for smoothing out changes in upstream data between
 * refreshes / reload.
 *
 * @example
 * when using RemoteData (or some other promise-based "eventually a value" resource),
 * the value returned from the API is what's useful to see to users. But if the URL
 * changes, the remote request will start anew, and isLoading becomes true, and the value is falsey until the request finishes. This can result in some flicker
 * until the new request finishes.
 *
 * To smooth that out, we can use [[keepLatest]]
 *
 * ```js
 *  import { RemoteData } from 'reactiveweb/remote-data';
 *  import { keepLatest } from 'reactiveweb/keep-latest';
 *  import { use } from 'ember-resources';
 *
 *  class A {
 *    @use request = RemoteData(() => 'some url');
 *    @use data = keepLatest({
 *      value: () => this.request.value,
 *      when: () => this.request.isLoading,
 *    });
 *
 *    get result() {
 *      // after the initial request, this is always resolved
 *      return this.data;
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * To specify a default value, use an additional getter
 * ```js
 *  import { RemoteData } from 'reactiveweb/remote-data';
 *  import { keepLatest } from 'reactiveweb/keep-latest';
 *  import { use } from 'ember-resources';
 *
 *  class A {
 *    @use request = RemoteData(() => 'some url');
 *    @use data = keepLatest({
 *      value: () => this.request.value,
 *      when: () => this.request.isLoading,
 *    });
 *
 *    get latest() {
 *      // after the initial request, this is always resolved
 *      return this.data;
 *    }
 *
 *    get result() {
 *      return this.latest ?? { default: 'value' };
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
